Please use this code responsibly.  I don't have to tell you that it's not a good idea to cheat on anything in school.

Just use the methods if you get stuck, or want to see how someone else did them.

I put my code on the internet in the hopes that others will find it, if they are in need of solutions to problems.  Not so that you can 
cheat in school.

That said, there's a lot of extra infrastructure within my codebase that you don't need to worry about.  The methods that I actually used
in codingbat are marked with comments.
